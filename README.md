# Mama 5 Fitness !

Created by Jacob Short

I wanted to create this website for my aspiring and motivating Mother. She is a mother of 5 ! Hence Mama-5-Fitness. 
She is pursuing her passion in fitness and health helping people across the nation improve their routine, regiment,
and way of life on a constant basic. Her unselfishness has inspired me to create this for her as a way for her to be able 
to showcase herself virtually! This site will have information about her business as well as her! I will be incorporating
a "assistant" which will be a 24/7 virtual bot that can answer many FAQ that you may be curious about! This will also
have links to her other sites which have individual needs!


I am have created the back-end server using nodeJS, express, and mongoDB which is a noSQL database. This was the first back-end 
stack I learned. To complete it I constructed the front-end using React JavaScript. I have done a few projects in React and 
am becoming more comfortable using JavaScripts famous framework. I am seeking to take on my next project in either VueJS or 
AngularJS to determine which I like to work with more. I know all 3 are very demanding. I al also currently taking Python classes 
and plan to integrate Pythons framekwork Django in one of my upcoming projects.
